    <p>The Lockheed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_CL-1201">CL-1201</a> was a design study by Lockheed for a 
    large 6,000-ton nuclear-powered transport aircraft during the late 1960s. One possible use of the concept was as an airborne aircraft carrier.
    Although the Department of Defense does not seem to have records of the study's ultimate outcome, the design itself has nonetheless been cited
    by several sources.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The CL-1201 design project studied a nuclear-powered aircraft of extreme size, with a wingspan of 1,120 feet (340 m). Had it been built, it would
    have had the largest wingspan of any airplane to date,  and more than three times that of any aircraft of the 20th century.
    The wing would be of crescent form, similar to the British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor">Handley Page Victor V-bomber</a>
    but, unlike the British design, it was tailless.
    A technical drawing of the nuclear power plant to be used in the CL-1201.
    Power would be derived from the heat generated by a nuclear reactor and transferred to four jet engines near the rear, where it would heat the air passing
    through to provide thrust. The craft would be capable of remaining airborne for extended periods, with an estimated 
    endurance of 41 days. At low altitudes, the jets would burn conventional aviation fuel. In order to take off, the airplane required 182 additional vertical
    lift engines. These were similar to those used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747">Boeing 747</a>, a new aircraft at the time.
    Two variants were studied, a logistics support aircraft and an airborne aircraft carrier. There was a rumored third variant, but information on such a model
    has never been made public.
    The logistics support variant would have a conventional heavy transport role, carrying hundreds of troops and their equipment at once.
    The airborne aircraft carrier would have carried as many as 22 fighter aircraft externally and would have had an internal dock capable of handling two air-to-ground
    shuttle transport aircraft.</p>


    <h2>Blueprint(s)</h2>

        <p>The nuclear aircraft powerplant depicted in the technical drawing is a complex system designed to generate power for an aircraft. At the heart of the system
        is the reactor vessel, which houses the nuclear reactor core. The reactor core contains a bed of UO2 pebbles that undergo fission, generating heat. 
        Surrounding the reactor vessel is the containment vessel, which provides an additional layer of safety and shielding. Coolant, likely a liquid metal, circulates
        through the reactor core to absorb the heat generated by the fission process. The coolant then passes through 
        a series of curved ducts and a coolant header, which distributes the heated coolant.
        The heated coolant is then used to drive a heat exchanger, which in turn powers a set of turbines. The turbines are connected to a compressor, which draws in air
        to feed the combustors. The combustors then use the mechanical power from the turbines to generate thrust for the aircraft.
        Throughout the system, there are various shielding components, including an outer neutron shield and impact energy absorber, as well as an impact energy absorbing and
        gamma and neutron shield, to protect the aircraft and its occupants from radiation and physical impacts.
        This integrated system of reactor, coolant, turbines, and combustors allows the nuclear aircraft powerplant to generate the necessary power to propel the aircraft, while
        incorporating multiple safety features to mitigate the risks associated with nuclear technology.</p>
