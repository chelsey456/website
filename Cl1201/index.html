    <p>The Lockheed CL-1201 was a design study by Lockheed for a large 6,000-ton nuclear-powered transport aircraft during the late 1960s. One possible use of the concept was as an airborne aircraft carrier.
    Although the Department of Defense does not seem to have records of the study's ultimate outcome, the design itself has nonetheless been cited by several sources.</p>
