    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-57"><b>SU 57</b></a> is a fifth generational, 
        twin engine, multirole fighter capable of aerial combat as well as ground and maritime strike, the Su-57 incorporates stealth, 
        supermaneuverability, supercruise, integrated avionics and large payload capacity. According to the US, 
        it will be nuclear-capable via a forthcoming missile similar to the Kinzhal. The aircraft is expected to succeed the MiG-29 and 
        Su-27 in the Russian military service and has also been marketed for export. The first prototype aircraft flew in 2010, but the program 
        experienced a protracted development due to various structural and technical issues that emerged during trials, including the destruction 
        of the first production aircraft in a crash before its delivery.
        The Su-57 is the first aircraft in Russian military service designed with stealth technology and is intended to be the basis for a 
        family of stealth combat aircraft.

    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>In 1979, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> outlined a need for next-generation fighter aircraft 
        intended to enter service in the 1990s. The programme became the I-90, and required the fighter to be "multifunctional" by having substantial ground attack capabilities, and would eventually 
        replace the MiG-29 and Su-27 in frontline tactical aviation service. Two subsequent projects were designed to meet these requirements: the 
        MFI and smaller LFI , with conceptual work beginning in 1983. Mikoyan was selected for the MFI and began developing its MiG 1.44/1.42. 
        Though not a participant in the MFI, Sukhoi started its own programme in 1983 to develop technologies for a next-generation fighter, 
        eventually resulting in the forward-swept wing S-32 experimental aircraft, later redesignated S-37 and then Su-47.
    
        Due to a lack of funds after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the MFI was repeatedly delayed and the first flight of the MiG 1.44/1.42 
        prototype did not occur until 2000, nine years behind schedule. Owing to the high costs, the MFI and LFI were eventually cancelled while the 
        Russian Ministry of Defence began work on a new next-generation fighter programme; in 1999, the ministry initiated the PAK FA or I-21 programme, 
        with the competition announced in April 2001. Because of Russia's financial difficulties, the programme aimed to rein in costs by producing
        a single multirole fifth-generation fighter that would replace the Su-27 and MIG-15. Further cost-saving measures include an intended size 
        in between that of the Su-27 and the MiG-29 and normal takeoff weight considerably smaller than the MiG MFI's 28.6 tonnes (63,000 lb) and the Su-47's 
        26.8 tonnes (59,000 lb).

    <h3>Research and Development</h3>
    <p>The research and development programme of the PAK FA was called Stolitsa. In 2002, Alexander Davidenko selected as the T-50's chief designer at Sukhoi.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk_Aircraft_Production_Association">Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPO)</a> and 
        Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAZ) would manufacture the new multi-role fighter, with KnAAZ performing final assembly at 
        Komsomol'sk-on-Amur. Following a competition held in 2003, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhomirov_
        Scientific_Research_Institute_of_Instrument_Design">Tekhnokompleks Scientific and Production Center</a>, 
        Ramenskoye Instrument Building Design Bureau, the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design (NIIP), the Ural Optical and 
        Mechanical Plant (UOMZ) in Yekaterinburg, the Polet firm in Nizhny Novgorod and the Central Scientific Research Radio Engineering Institute 
        in Moscow were selected for the development of the PAK FA's avionics suite. In April 2004,  
        NPO Lyulka-Saturn (now NPO Saturn) was signed as the contractor for the AL-41F1 engines with the development designation izdeliye 117.

        Sukhoi used existing airframes as testbeds for various subsystems and concepts; the Su-47 tested internal weapon bays, and Su-27M prototypes 
        served as testbeds for the flight control system and engines. To reduce developmental risk and spread out associated costs, as well as to 
        bridge the gap with extant fourth generation fighters, Sukhoi implemented some of the T-50's technology and features,
        such as propulsion and certain avionics, in an advanced derivative of the Su-27 called the T-10BM, which was eventually procured by the Russian Ministry of Defence in 2009 and entered service as the Su-35S in 2014.
        In December 2004, the T-50's conceptual design and shape was complete and approved by the Ministry of Defence; government funding of the programme began in 2005 and drastically increased in 2006 when detailed design was underway.
        On 8 August 2007, Russian Air Force Commander-in-Chief Alexander Zelin was quoted by Russian news agencies that the programme's development stage was complete and construction of the first aircraft for flight testing would begin, 
        with three flyable T-50 prototypes planned to be built by 2009. In 2009, the aircraft's design was officially approved. The T-50 was named Su-57 in July 2017.

    <h3>Procurment</h3>
    <p>The procurement plans for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-57">PAK FA </a>have been considerably scaled back and delayed from original plans. In 2011, the Ministry of Defence had planned on buying the first 10 aircraft for evaluation after 2012 and 60 production standard aircraft after 2015.
        These plans were refined under the State Armament Programme from 2011 to 2020 (GPV-2020), with serial production hoped to begin in 2016; the Ministry of Defence was planning to acquire 52 aircraft by 2020, and another 
        150–160 by 2025. Additionally, export orders for 250–300 FGFA were expected to begin in 2017. lans were greatly cut down in 2015 as a result of technical obstacles encountered during testing, India's unclear commitment to the partnership, and Russia's 
        economic downturn due to international sanctions after its annexation of Crimea and the drop in oil prices. Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Yury Borisov stated in 2015 that the Russian Air Force would slow production, reduce its initial order to 12 fighters, 
        and operate large fleets of upgraded fourth-generation fighters such as the Su-35S and the Su-30SM. In 2017, Borisov stated that the PAK FA would most likely enter service in 2018 and be part of the new State Armament Programme from 2018 to 2027 (GPV-2027). 
        On 30 June 2018, an order for 12 aircraft was agreed, while deliveries to the Russian Armed Forces was pushed back again to 2019 with the first aircraft planned to join fighter regiments at the Lipetsk Air Center. At the same time, Borisov praised the Su-35S, 
        stating that it was comparable to the Su-57 except for the stealth features while being more affordable.

        Due to the substantially higher cost of the Su-57 compared to the Su-35S and Su-30SM, the design was placed on hold for mass production until the need arises. On 22 August 2018, during the International Military-Technical Forum, the Defence Ministry and 
        Sukhoi signed the first contract for delivery of two serial Su-57 fighters scheduled for 2019 and 2020 respectively. In January 2019, the Ministry of Defence announced they hoped to conclude a second contract for 13 more aircraft in 2020.

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>The Su-57 is a fifth-generation multirole fighter aircraft and the first operational stealth aircraft for the Russian armed forces. In addition to stealth, the fighter emphasizes supermaneuverability in all aircraft axes, capacious internal payload bays for multirole 
        versatility, and advanced sensor systems such as active phased-array radar as well as the integration of these systems to achieve high levels of automation. In the Su-57's design, Sukhoi cited the Lockheed Martin F-22 as the baseline for a supermaneuverable stealth fighter, 
        but addressed what the bureau considered to be the limitations, such as the inability to use thrust vectoring to induce roll and yaw moments, a lack of space for weapons bays between the engines resulting in insufficient payload, and complications for post-stall recovery if 
        thrust vectoring fails. In particular, Sukhoi considered the F-22 design unsuitable as a multirole fighter required for PAK FA due to the limited payload that was too focused on air-to-air missiles. The aircraft has a wide blended wing body fuselage with two widely spaced 
        engines and has all-moving horizontal and vertical stabilisers, with the vertical stabilisers canted for stealth; the trapezoid wings have leading edge flaps, ailerons, and flaperons. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and large leading edge root extensions that 
        shift the aerodynamic center forward, increasing static instability and maneuverability. These extensions have adjustable leading–edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control the generated vortices and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, 
        including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. To air-brake, the ailerons deflect up while the flaperons deflect down and the vertical stabilisers toe inward to increase drag. Although the majority of the structural materials are alloys 
        with 40.5 to 44.5% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium">alluminium</a> alloys and 18.6% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium">titanium</a> alloys, the aircraft makes extensive use of composites, with the material comprising 22–26% of the structural 
        weight and approximately 70% of the outer surface.
